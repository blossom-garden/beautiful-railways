### Notes

Thanks to the mod [Create Train Physics](https://modrinth.com/mod/5nYnKExR) by Szedann, Create Trains now will obey some
physics. According to the mod's description there is now a need for a Steam Engine Block (or any other block on the
`#create_train_physics:train_motor` tag) for Trains to actually move, and as a plus, train mass is taken into account
for climbs and acceleration. If this sounds like a nuisance to you just remove the mod!

> [!TIP]
> Remember that Steam Engines need tanks to be placed but not to stay placed! This modpack also offers a
> [datapack](./datapacks) that adds blast furnaces to the `#create_train_physics:train_motor` tag)
